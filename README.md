## Topic: Implementation of the system for managing surplus electricity production from a photovoltaic installation.
## Description:
There is currently an increased tendency to invest in photovoltaic installations. The most favourable billing conditions for prosumers offered by energy providers are zero electricity bill per billing period. In this situation, when we experience particularly sunny weather, the surplus electricity generated is irretrievably lost to the energy provider. We can therefore lean towards using another technology gaining popularity, blockchain and the phenomenon of "mining" cryptocurrencies using the Proof of Work method. The system is designed to continuously monitor the balance of a household's electricity consumption in order to manage, in real time, the hardware resources that generate digital revenue and maximise profit from the solar energy produced.
